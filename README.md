## Installations

We provide Julia notebooks in this repository. The two main ingredients required are Jupyter Notebook and Julia (> 1.9 recommended).

### Installing Julia and extension for notebooks in vscode

VScode is recommended. To install Julia and the VScode extension:

The files for each session are given below.
## Day 1, Feb. 13:
* [Automatic differentiation for univeriate functions and dual numbers](Day1/Univariate.ipynb)
* [Automatic differentiation for multivariate functions and pushforward/pullback](Day1/Multivariate.ipynb)
* [Example: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)](Day1/CodeExample.ipynb)

## Day 2, Feb. 20:
* TBC
